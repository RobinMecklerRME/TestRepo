# Calculator Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Description
User reported that adding 0.1 and 0.1 returns 2 instead of the expected 0.2.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through comprehensive testing and code analysis, the mathematical logic was found to be correct. However, a potential synchronization bug was identified in the `DecimalButton_Click` method that could cause the display text and internal `currentInput` variable to become out of sync under certain edge cases.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Decimal Input Synchronization Fix
**Location:** `Calculator/CalculatorForm.cs` - `DecimalButton_Click` method

**Problem:** The `currentInput` variable was only updated when a decimal point was actually added to the display. If the decimal button was pressed when the display already contained a decimal point, `currentInput` would not be updated to match the current display state.

**Solution:** Moved the `currentInput = displayTextBox.Text;` assignment outside the conditional block to ensure it's always executed.

```csharp
// Before (buggy):
if (!displayTextBox.Text.Contains("."))
{
    displayTextBox.Text += ".";
    currentInput = displayTextBox.Text;  // Only updated when decimal is added
}

// After (fixed):
if (!displayTextBox.Text.Contains("."))
{
    displayTextBox.Text += ".";
}
currentInput = displayTextBox.Text;  // Always updated
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Location:** `Calculator/CalculatorForm.cs` - `PerformCalculation` method

**Problem:** When parse errors or division by zero occurred, the calculator state variables were not properly reset, potentially leaving the calculator in an inconsistent state.

**Solution:** Added proper state reset in error conditions.

```csharp
if (!double.TryParse(currentInput, out double secondNumber))
{
    displayTextBox.Text = "Error";
    currentInput = "";           // Reset state
    operation = "";              // Reset state  
    isOperationPerformed = false; // Reset state
    return;
}
```

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite was developed including:
- Direct mathematical operation tests
- UI interaction simulation tests
- Edge case testing (multiple decimal button presses)
- Synchronization validation tests
- Error condition tests

All tests pass, confirming the fix resolves potential synchronization issues without breaking existing functionality.

## Impact
This fix prevents potential UI state synchronization issues that could cause unexpected calculator behavior, particularly in decimal number input scenarios. While the specific "0.1 + 0.1 = 2" issue could not be reproduced, the fix addresses the most likely root cause of such synchronization problems.
